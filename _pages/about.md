### About

Welcome! I'm a strategy consultant, healthcare specialist, and data & computer science enthusiast with expertise in enterprise strategic planning, US healthcare payor & provider operations, and data analytics.

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Quantitative Sciences from **Emory University**, where I double majored in Film & Media Studies. Currently, I'm a Corporate Strategy Consultant at **Humana**, where my role involves shaping organizational strategies through market research, growth opportunity analysis, and developing strategic insights to guide executive decision-making.

Some of my key accomplishments include:

1. Proposing innovative data solutions to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of claims forecasting processes

2. Reimagining the internal physician executive recruitment program to strengthen company-wide talent strategy

3. Developing an interactive Power BI dashboard to track key business metrics related to enterprise-wide integration efforts

4. Advising senior finance leaders on the on-going COVID impact on pricing decisions and trend projections

5. Preparing strategic materials for executive management, Board of Directors meetings, and investor presentations

Outside the corporate world, I'm passionate about fashion and co-founded **Divine Mercy**, an accessible streetwear brand aimed at introducing Western street culture to China. I also occasionally buy, [sell](https://www.grailed.com/1359775899), and trade vintage and archival designer clothing.

### Interests & Writing

In my free time, I enjoy staying active with tennis, boxing, hiking, and snowboarding. I'm also an avid traveler, reader, and film photographer.

As a dedicated cin√©phile, I spend considerable time watching, analyzing, and writing about films and TV series, especially from the Classic Hollywood era, various New Wave movements, and Italian Neorealism. You can explore my insights and analyses on my [blog](blog/category/film/).

I'm also intrigued by the ways technology continues to shape the world. You can follow my ongoing reflections and notes on these topics as my learning journey evolves.

Outside of work, I enjoy sports (tennis, boxing, hiking, snowboarding), traveling, reading, thrifting, and film photography.
