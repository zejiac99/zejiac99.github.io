While many of his antecedent films, such as <i>Rashomon</i> (1950) and <i>Throne of Blood</i> (1957), epitomized his keen assimilation of classic western literature and philosophical ideas, in <i>High and Low</i> (Akira Kurosawa, 1963) Kurosawa showed off his superb mastery of cinematography, mise-en-scene, and editing in translating character's psychology and implicit meanings unobtrusively, making it truly a film of its time. </div> </div> </div> <p><em>High and Low</em> can be demarcated into two very different but both equally phenomenal halves. The first act is a seemingly theatrical drama that follows Gondo (Mifune Toshiro), a business executive at a shoe company whose chauffeur’s son is kidnapped in place of his own in the midst of his ambitious leveraged buyout in gaining control of the corporation.</p> <h3 id="a-farcical-extortion">A Farcical Extortion</h3> <p>Although the first half of the film’s narrative is entirely set in a single space - Gondo’s resplendent mansion, it does not prevent Kurosawa from portraying each character’s internal emotions through appropriate blocking and frame composition. Having realized that it is the chauffeur’s son (Shimazu Masahiko) who ended up missing, in the frame where Gondo is about to answer the call from the kidnapper (Yamazaki Tsutomu) with the chauffeur (Sada Yutaka), the assistant (Mihashi Tatsuya) and the chief detective (Ishiyama Kenjiro) surrounding him, Kurosawa aptly employs blocking to embody their inner psychology that is congruous with their characteristics.</p> <p>Gondo, the main figure who is responsible for paying the ransom, is placed in the foreground of the image, while Aoki, the most agitating one, is in the back center yearning for any possible information that may keep his son from danger. Such spatial relationships present the two central figures to the conflicts, and, at the same time, accentuate the power hierarchy between the two. Gondo is the one who overrules everything, as he is exercising his agency in answering the call, yet Aoki, a menial salaryman who is not relevant to any negotiations, is held off at a distance.</p> <p>Two remaining characters are also deliberately placed to not only fill up the frame but also reveal their motivations. From the beginning, we have already known that Kawanishi (the assistant) is working in collusion with Gondo’s business rival to go against him. Hence, we can clearly see how Kawanishi’s position in the frame is consonant with his motivation as he situates at the left corner away from the other three, poking his neck to clandestinely spy for any exploitable intel without explicitly interfering the main action. On the opposite side of Kawanishi is the chief detective, another main figure of the film who aims to rescue the kid without jeopardizing Gondo’s assets. Unlike Kawanishi, he sits just in between Gondo and Aoki, striving to resolve the primary conflict. By spacing each individual in these specific positions, the character’s natural behavior evinces the nature of their behavior, which is why Kurosawa is considered a master of incorporating mise-en-scene to bestow another layer of meanings upon the surface.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/hal_1.png" data-lightbox="cat_1"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/hal_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> A single shot is enough to capture each character's inner psychology and the power dynamics in between </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <h3 id="the-theatrical-aspect-of-high-and-low">The Theatrical Aspect of <em>High and Low</em></h3> <p>Right in the next scene, combined with orchestrated character movement and punctilious editing, Kurosawa again exhibits his deep understanding of implementing stylistic devices to gain control over the plot progression.</p> <p>When Gondo picks up the phone, rather than letting the viewer wait and see what exactly the kidnapper has to offer, the narrative fasts forward to later where everyone has gotten together to review the kidnapper’s words in the living room, forming another spectacular scene that captures each individual’s reaction and psyche in response to the moral conundrum. At the beginning of the scene, as the chief detective starts to play the recording, an establishing shot of the room is displayed to portray every person’s close attention to the kidnapper’s response (shot 1). Being notified about the abductor’s perverse demand, Gondo, who initially sits beside his family, gradually walks toward the back away from the crowd, realizing that he must now make a difficult choice between the boy and his company (shot 2).</p> <p>In the next second, however, the scene quickly cuts to a new frame where Gondo and Aoki, in parallel with each other, both contemplate where the crisis will end up going (shot 3). Aoki, having no control over the situation and facing forward anxiously, is hoping Gondo is kind enough to pay the ransom and save his son. Gondo, on the other hand, is more inclined to not pay the ransom for the sake of his company, but also he feels guilty for his indifference as he faces backward, avoiding taking on any responsibilities. The empty space in between, like an unmade decision, lingers, just as we are waiting to see how the quandary can be ultimately resolved.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/hal_2.png" data-lightbox="cat_2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/hal_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> shot 1 </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/hal_3.png" data-lightbox="cat_2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/hal_3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> shot 2 </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/hal_4.png" data-lightbox="cat_2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/hal_4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> shot 3 </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>Then, just when the kidnapper continues with his threat, Gondo begins to move further back into the frame, as a symbol of deep compunction when hearing his assertion for not paying the ransom over the phone. At the same time, his assistant at the left corner leaves the seat in an attempt to calm him down. Forthwith, the camera again cuts to the same poison ditto (shot 4), but with Gondo, Aoki, and Kawanishi positioning themselves in relation to each other. Being informed by Gondo’s rejection, the distance between Gondo and Aoki stretches to a greater extend, connoting the dichotomy between their self-interest. Yet, as Kawanishi walks toward Gondo, his entrance to the frame breaks the equilibrium. Now, Gondo and Kawanishi are on the left side while Aoki is being left out at the right corner. Such unbalanced frame composition signifies Gondo’s strong propensity for not paying the ransom at the moment.</p> <p>After the abductor hangs up the phone, the scene cuts back to the previous establishing shot (shot 5), but now with Gondo situates at the back of the center and Kawanishi covers up the empty space he left, saturating the frame to its fullest. Throughout the sequence, Kurosawa consciously utilizes the multiple-camera system and the editing to maneuver the entire scene from different vantage points, magnifying the main characters’ troubled states meanwhile “allowing the actors to play the entire scene without any interruptions.” (Bordwell, 380)</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/hal_5.png" data-lightbox="cat_3"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/hal_5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> shot 4 </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/hal_6.png" data-lightbox="cat_3"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/hal_6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> shot 5 </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <h3 id="kurosawa-and-time">Kurosawa and Time</h3> <p>Kurosawa’s eminent cinematic language does not just manifest through his manipulation of space, but time as well.</p> <p>Although the narrative in the first half of the film is seemingly linear, it does not prevent him to put small twists to advance the plot. Kurosawa uses the tape recorder as a device to handle the narrative progression. From the scene aforementioned, we have already seen how he advances the plot by skipping Gondo and the kidnapper’s phone call and cutting to the recording directly. In the scene where Gondo and the police are preparing for the ransom delivery the next day. Kurosawa once more employs the tape recorder as a medium to play with the narrative. According to the previous plot, we know that, in the morning, the kidnapper promises to think through Gondo’s offer that he will only pay the ransom after first seeing the boy alive. Shortly after, however, the scene has already cut to the evening as the police are preparing the ransom (shot 6), not letting us have any information about the kidnapper’s response yet. It is not until later when the chief detective begins to play the recording, that we then get to be notified apropos of the train delivery and the police’s ploy.</p> <p>Another detail worths noticing is at the end of the first act when Gonda picks up his training as an apprentice to hide the powder inside the suitcase for tracking the kidnapper down . Gondo, sitting at the golden ratio spot of the frame, is tweaking the suitcase while others respectively put their works aside, standing upright to pay reverence to his great sacrifice. By carefully staging each character’s position and arranging their movement, Kurosawa is able to direct our eyes to where we exactly need to. The extreme contrast of Gondo sitting with everyone else standing also signifies Gondo’s downfall as he mocks “It’s like I’m starting over already.” (shot 7)</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/hal_7.png" data-lightbox="cat_4"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/hal_7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> shot 6 </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/hal_8.png" data-lightbox="cat_4"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/hal_8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> shot 7 </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <h3 id="final-thought">Final Thought</h3> <p>The extraordinary thing about <em>High and Low</em> though is that it does not just focus the narrative on a one man’s drama. In Japanese, the film’s title is closer to Heaven and Hell, but the English title High and Low works appositely with Kurosawa’s theme. It is a story about wealth and property, hope and despair, good and evil. Unlike most of Kurosawa’s samurai epics which embody a clear boundary of right and wrong, <em>High and Low</em> is full of contrast and ambivalence. Is the kidnapper’s motif purely stemmed from jealousy? Is the fact that Gondo decides to pay the ransom due to a sudden epiphany or from his intention to collect sympathy from the public? Is it ethical for the police to postpone the apprehension just for the sake of getting the death sentence on the kidnapper that wind up causing another woman’s life? At the end of the day, there are no definitive answers to these questions, and Kurosawa leaves them to our own interpretation.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="film"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A close examination of Akira Kurosawa's mastery in cinematography and mise-en-scene]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">French New Wave and the Francois Truffaut’s legacy</title><link href="https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2021/shoot-the-piano-player/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="French New Wave and the Francois Truffaut’s legacy"/><published>2021-02-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2021/shoot-the-piano-player</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2021/shoot-the-piano-player/"><![CDATA[<div class="l-body-outset"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_1.jpeg" data-lightbox="french-new-wave"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> The French New Wave, in general, was about both iconoclasm and reverence for the long-lasting film traditions. If the fragmentary editing epitomized by jarring jump cuts, and the extended long takes consisted of medley montages in New Wave films were a testimony against the institutionalized cinema, then, the adoption and references of antecedent film movements and genres were the most sincere accolade to early art-cinemas from the New Wave directors. </div> </div> </div> <p><em>Shoot the Piano Player</em> (Francois Truffaut, 1960), Truffaut’s second feature film may on the surface level may feel like a modest tale of crime thriller centering on pianist Charlie’s (Charles Aznavour) entanglement in a bizarre cat-and-mouse game. However, it is full of intimation and little eccentricities worthy of the viewers’ attention, crystalizing the spirit of the French New Wave. </p> <h3 id="the-new-wave-in-action">The New Wave in Action</h3> <p>It is often noted how many of the directors within the New Wave made references to classic film movements and genres; so did Truffaut. For instance, the claustrophobic atmosphere stemmed from the chiaroscuro lighting schemes, and the dramatic shadow patterning right at the opening of the film is his direct tribute to the classic American noir films (1:50). Yet, this 4-min sequence is full of Truffaut’s acute implementation of salient New Wave stylistic elements. The scene starts with a chase sequence displaying Chico (Albert Remy) running for life from the two gangsters (Daniel Boulanger, Claude Mansard) pursuing. The interposition of shots of Chico sprinting and the car following with disoriented camera movements are the distinct language of the New Wave directors who knowingly twist temporal and spatial continuity. At the same time, Truffaut adopts the nonlinear storyline from neorealist films to play with the narrative a bit. While the viewers are still fixated on the thrilling chase sequence, in the next second Chico is stunned by a streetlight and soon gets rescued by a stranger (Alex Joffe) just passing by (2:37). Rather than return to Chico’s escape, for the next two minutes, the narrative digresses instead to capture Chico and the stranger having a casual conversation about life, love, and marriage. It is not until the stranger disappears at the corner (and never reappears in the rest of the film), the chase again carries on.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_2.jpeg" data-lightbox="cat_2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_2.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_3.jpeg" data-lightbox="cat_2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_3.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_4.jpeg" data-lightbox="cat_2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_4.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption text-center"> The chase scene digresses to the small talk between Chico and the stranger </div> </div> <p>Still, the innovative editing and the episodic narrative structure are just one snippet of cinematic elements that Truffaut utilizes in <em>Shoot the Piano Player</em>. Followed by the wildly acclaimed debut The 400 Blows (Francois Truffaut, 1959), Truffaut continued to masterfully maneuver the frame to draw audiences’ attention to a specific point in the scene. In the final snowbound shootout with the gangsters (79:00), Lena (Marie Dubois) gets accidentally shot at on her way looking for Charlie. When Charlie finally shows up, everything is too late as Lena, covered in snow, has lost her breath already. As Charlie holds Lena with remorse, rather conventionally cut to a close-up of Lena’s face, Truffaut employs a combination of zoom shot and freeze-frame to immortalize this poignant moment, magnifying Charlie’s anguish in losing the beloved one. </p> <h3 id="injections-of-drollery">Injections of Drollery</h3> <p>Truffaut takes the free-wheeling side of the French New Wave further by implementing gentle humor into his film even if the tone and subject matters can be quite intense. In the scene where Charlie and Lena have been kidnapped by the gangsters, for example, Truffaut turns a supposed agitated maneuver with the criminals into a waggish slapstick (25:30). Despite being kidnapped, Charlie and Lena keep having discussion apropos of driving, women, and sex with the two gangsters along the way, as if they have known each other for a long time. Then, noticing that the two gangsters have let down their guards, Lena pushes her foot on the drivers’s pedal in an attempt to get the car pulled over. The tactic is successful, allowing Charlie and Lena to walk away with ease while the gangsters have to end the kidnapping to deal with a passing traffic policeman. Interpolating these humorous aspects within the story again emphasizes the versatility and playfulness of this film alone.</p> <p>Sometimes <em>Shoot the Piano Player</em> becomes reflexive as Truffaut reflects on the making of the film and makes flippant remarks about it. In an erotic scene where Charlie is about to enjoy himself for the rest of the night as Clarisse (Michele Mercier), already naked, is lying next to him (20:58), Charlie takes the bedsheet to cover Clarisse’s breast, joking “This is how it’s done in the movies.” Just like that, Truffaut, in sleight of hand, integrates his jocular comment about the classic Hollywood’s finicky Production Code, evincing his attitude towards the need for modern movies to disregard any forms of restriction.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_5.png" data-lightbox="cat_3"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> my favorite scene in <i>Shoot the Piano Player</i> </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <h3 id="truffauts-brilliance">Truffaut’s Brilliance</h3> <p>Besides, Truffaut did not apply all the cinematic elements of the French New Wave just for the sake of applying it; what really appeals to him in making the film is the sense of loneliness and alienation that is suggested for the protagonist. Charlie, a passe classical pianist, is portrayed as a diffident and reticent person who seems to be a little bit cut off from the rest of the world. In order to reflect such personality appropriately, Truffaut makes use of many New Wave stylistic devices, along with voiceovers and flashbacks, guiding the viewers into Charlie’s psyche. The voiceover is the most frequent and effective device that sheds light on Charlie’s subjective thoughts throughout the film. In particular, in the sequence where Charlie accompanies Lena back home right off the work (15:30), the close-ups of Charlie’s hand seeking to hold Lena’s is juxtaposed with shots of his restrained face. Such thoughtful editing is an apposite representation of Charlie’s lack of courage in taking initiatives, exemplifying his agitated state at the moment. The subsequent voiceover of Charlie searching for improvisations to break the silence once again directly demonstrates to the viewer Charlie’s reserved character.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_6.png" data-lightbox="cat_4"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> Montage of increasingly close-up shots to embody Charlie's unsettlement when it comes to audition </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_7.png" data-lightbox="cat_4"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/stpp_7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> The camera stays with the young woman after Charlie entering the audition room </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>Another brilliant example of Truffaut’s keen link of visual style with the story’s idea and characterizations is the audition scene. Truffaut deliberately utilizes montage to call attention to Charlie’s psychology. As Charlie walks across the corridor and about to enter the audition room (33:53), first a medium close-up of Charlie playing with the door key is shown. Forthwith, we get three different close-ups of his finger teasing the door bell within different scales, and then a long shot from the end of the hall which completely jolts us back out again. The montage of Charlie’s hesitant actions plus the elongated corridor scene reinforce the idea of hollowness, as his ambivalent behavior keeps haunting him.</p> <p>What’s more scintillating is that, in the next shot, the door is opened by a young lady who has just finished her audition. In most cases, we would expect the camera to follow Charlie entering the audition room and watching him performing in front of the judges. Surprisingly, the camera instead stays with this young lady, tracking back with her as she walks through the corridor and out of the building. Such an open-ended sequence epitomizes Truffaut’s mastery of the incidental narrative structure, and makes us wonder about his ulterior motif in creating it. Is he showing the lady because she might just be another victim of the sexual harassment just like Charlie’s dead wife, or because he simply wants to? By conscientiously incorporating stylistic features from the New Wave, meanwhile, blending his uptake of the modern cinema, Truffaut in harmony, creates an idiosyncratic film language that is distinct from any other coeval peers.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="film"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An investigation about The French New Wave and how its innovative, iconoclastic styles epitomizes in Francois Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Soviet Montage Movement</title><link href="https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/soviet-montage/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Soviet Montage Movement"/><published>2020-12-20T15:46:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-20T15:46:00+00:00</updated><id>https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/soviet-montage</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/soviet-montage/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3> <p>During the Montage movement, Soviet films were relatively similar in terms of genres. As Lenin declared, “Of all the arts, for us the cinema is the most important,” (Bordwell, 107) The Bolshevik regime realized that the cinema was the most powerful tool for propaganda and education, given the 80% rates of illiteracy and the mix of vernaculars straddled across the country. Hence, we could see a great similarity in films directed by most of the Montage directors during that time. Depictions of uprisings, strikes, and rebellion against the authoritarian regime were extremely popular among directors who emphasized the Bolshevik ideology in films.</p> <p>Both <em>Battleship Potemkin</em> (Eisenstein, 1925) and <em>Mother</em> (Pudovkin, 1926) include various strikes and demonstration sequences to highlight the tension between the authorities and civilians, commemorating the failed Revolution of 1905. In order to be as comprehensible to the viewers as possible, intertitles in both <em>Mother</em> and <em>Battleship Potemkin</em> were simple and concise. Phrases like “It was spring”, “Even a dog wouldn’t eat this”, and “Brothers!” helped to maintain the continuity in the narratives, but also powerful enough to evoke the spectator’s emotion about the Bolsheviks’ solidarity in the revolution.</p> <h3 id="pudovkin-and-eisenstein">Pudovkin and Eisenstein</h3> <h5 id="pudovkin">Pudovkin</h5> <p>As Bordwell points out in Film History, “…it [montage] also served more abstract purposes, linking two actions for the sake of a thematic point.” (117) The use of montage to construct narrative and court spectators’ attention was prevalent among Soviets directors, and Pudovkin and Eisenstein are prime examples. Despite their consensus on the search for dynamism through montage, Pudovkin and Eisenstein, however, diverged drastically regarding the role which montage played in film narration. Greatly influenced by Kuleshov, Pudovkin inherited the idea of continuity editing from Hollywood, in which filmmaker created an immersive experience for the viewer to match reality in a natural way. Pointed out by Pudovkin in his Selected Essays, “The director despotically manipulate the viewer’s attention. The viewer sees only what the director shows him”(35). He stressed the use of montage to achieve the “the maximum simplicity”(36) and “clarity in resolving each individual problem”(36) when constructing a sequence.</p> <p>In the first sequence of <em>Mother</em>, when the mother (Vera Baranovskaya) is being abused by the alcoholic husband (Aleksandr Chistyakov), Pudovkin employed techniques like match-on-action and eye-line matches to cut between numerous shots to highlight each protagonist’s personality, but also intelligibly establish the family dynamics with little explanation. The back-and-forth cuts of father and the son (Nikolay Batalov) and respective close-ups of the hammer and the father’s clenched hands, captures the family’s extreme tension and the son’s resolution to protect his mother. Reminiscent of the last-minute rescue sequence in <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> (D. W. Griffith, 1915), the crosscutting between the prison riot and the protest march in the last sequence of <em>Mother</em>, helps to build up the final culmination, and captivate the audience’s attention in a state of intense excitement.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/sm_1.jpg" data-lightbox="soviet-montage"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/sm_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> <i>Mother</i> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/sm_2.jpg" data-lightbox="soviet-montage"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/sm_2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> The Kuleshov Effect employed in the first sequence of <i>Mother</i> </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <h5 id="eisenstein">Eisenstein</h5> <p>Rather than paying excessive attention to maintain a comprehensible narrative like Pudovkin, Eisenstein was more radical and more experimental in terms of what montage could achieve. In his theory of film, Eisenstein often brought up the term “conflict” in which “antithetical elements clash and produce a synthesis that goes beyond both.” (Bordwell, 113) Eisenstein did not see montage as a resort to maintain a clear temporal and spatial relationship, guiding the spectator through the entire narrative. Rather he envisioned each individual shot or sequence as if it was a puzzle with meanings of their own. When combined, however, these individual shots created an utterly different picture, sparking new meaning that was not present in either of the original shots.</p> <p>The infamous Odessa stairs sequence in <em>Battleship Potemkin</em> is the moment when Eisenstein fully actualizes his “intellectual montage” theory. Shots of soldiers marching down steps symbolize an oppressive force juxtaposed with unarmed civilians fleeing, barring the straightforward indication of the helplessness of the Russian people, offers new meanings of the Russian Empire’s forces’ brutality. The last sequence of the Odessa massacre constitutes shots of the stroller sliding downstairs across dead bodies, the slaughter of civilians, and close-ups of a woman’s face, covered with blood. Albeit the considerable lack of spatial and temporal relation, the sequence’s short and sharp intercuts epitomize the agony of innocuous civilians, insinuating the viciousness of the Russian army. Besides, Eisenstein deliberately intercuts three consecutive shots of stone lion statues when illustrating the bombardment of the Odess theater. Although shots of the lion may not mean much on their own, when combined, it seems like the lion is rising from its sleep. They signify the Odessa people waking up and fighting against the totalitarian regime and seemingly paralleled with the first half of the film, where asleep crews ignite the revolution on battleship Potemkin. </p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/sm_3.jpg" data-lightbox="soviet-montage"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/sm_3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> The Odessa Stairs sequence </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/sm_4.jpeg" data-lightbox="soviet-montage"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/sm_4.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> The lion montage displayed in the <i>Battleship Potemkin</i> </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3> <p>At the beginning of the 1930s, audiences, who were tired of the esoteric style of montage, began to demand for something more accessible and more evocative.

However, De Sica, in both the uses of linear and episodic narrative structures, earnestly create one of the most wondrous and heart-rending masterpieces, portraying the vicissitude of a person living in post-WWII Italy.</p> <h3 id="a-simple-story-about-father-and-son">A Simple Story about Father and Son</h3> <p>In the majority of Hollywood productions, the characters in film often have sets of goals or deadlines (this is often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_editing">continuous editing</a>). All the events that occur in the film are designed to advance the plot to meet these goals and achieve a consummate finale. The same logical narrative structure also applies to <em>Bicycle Thieves</em>. Like the film title suggests, the whole film’s narrative settles around the bicycle. Throughout the film, Ricci’s actions and behaviors are mostly driven by his motivation to recover his beloved bicycle. And we can see a clear linear causal logic in the narrative structure just at the beginning, establishing the cause and setting the goal of the film.   </p> <p>As the film starts, we follow a medium shot of a bus stopping by the unemployment office with a crowd of job seekers rushing to the gate, longing for the slightest chance of securing a position. Along with the movement of a worker leaving the crowd yelling for Ricci, the scene is cut to a panoramic shot, establishing the temporal space surrounded for the first time . Despite having lost faith in job searching, Ricci is fortuitous enough to procure a job of pasting posters among the massive unemployed, but a bicycle is a requisite to secure the position. Henceforth, a dissolve transition leads us to the next scene, where Ricci is walking backed home with his wife, Maria (Lianella Carell), informing her about the dilemma he faces. Considering that it is a luxury for Ricci to secure a job, notwithstanding the indigent status, they decide to sell their bedsheets to earn the money for the bike. Just as Maria begins to wash the sheets and getting them ready to impawn, at the very next shot, the scene has already dissolved to the pawnshop where Maria is bargaining with the staff, begging to trade the sheets for a better price.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/bt_1.jpg" data-lightbox="bicycle-thieves"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/bt_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> The tilted shot of the pawn shop filled with used bedsheets signifies the impoverished condition of post-WWII Italy </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>With all the sacrifices, Ricci finally gets what he has dreamed of, a bicycle that allows him to support his family of four. With his beloved bicycle, in the next sequence, Ricci arrives forthwith at the employment office to register to be an official poster hanger. From firstly securing the job, and being notified about the prerequisite, to the family having to trade the bedsheets for the bicycle, until finally Ricci acquires the job in the employment office, the very beginning of <em>Bicycle Thieves</em> rigorously follows a <strong>linear, causal narrative structure</strong>. In a mere 10 minutes length, De Sica adapts continuous editing to outline the general context of Ricci and his bicycle in a logical and succinct manner.</p> <h3 id="the-episodic-narrative-takes-over">The episodic narrative takes over</h3> <p>It is ostensibly a simple plot if we only choose to look at the first 20 minutes of <em>Bicycle Thieves</em>. However, as Ricci’s bike is stolen and he starts the fruitless search, the episodic approach to story-telling, from time to time, supplants the causal narrative as an alternative mean to advance the narrative till the end. “The film unfolds on the level of accident” (Bazin, 59). Bazin’s words shed light on the involuntary nature of De Sica’s episodic narration. The hopeless search of the father and the son (Enzo Staiola) happens very naturally, as they meandering in the city of Rome with no particular destinations in mind. The film takes us to multiple spots through the two’s search: the union gathering, the police station, the spare parts market, the seer, and the church, some are for the sake of looking for the stolen bike while others are virtually out of spontaneity. Nonetheless, we are forced to follow the lens to observe, to feel the tension and the struggle of the bottom of the society without the film explicitly spelling it out for the audience. </p> <p>The scene where Ricci and Bruno shelter from the rain is a classic exemplar of De Sica’s dedramatized approach to the narrative. Just as Ricci and Bruno are on the way to another spare parts market, a pouring rain interrupts their miserable search. Several long shots firstly illustrate them standing in the rain at a loss, as people and vendors are fleeing for shelter. Then the scene cuts to the close-up shots, as Ricci wandering, keeping Bruno by his side, anxiously looking for any possible traces of his stolen bike. Just when the rain gets heavier and heavier, in despair, Ricci and Bruno decide to halt the search momentarily and shelter under a roof. A span of 2-minutes shelter scene begins with a brief conversation between the two about Ricci’s inadvertent behavior to his son. Then, out of nowhere, a group of foreign seminarians comes to the roof for shelter. They speak an utterly different language (there are not any subtitles given). Interestingly, however, De Sica did not immediately cut to the next scene where the rain is already over. Instead, we are just as trapped and confused as Ricci and Bruno, being forced to spend time listening to the querulous chatters till the rain is over.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/bt_2.jpeg" data-lightbox="bicycle-thieves-2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/bt_2.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> An random encounter with seminarians seemingly adds no constructive advancement to the plot but is indeed how life sometimes unfolds </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/bt_3.jpeg" data-lightbox="bicycle-thieves-2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/bt_3.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="500"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> The back and forth shot between the rich and Bruno </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>Another salient example of De Sica’s brilliant episodic narration is the restaurant scene. After an irresponsible reprimand to Bruno and having feared that he has drowned, Ricci finally realizes his obliviousness to his son that all this time his focus is just to find the bicycle, because of how much the it means to him. To make up for the previous impropriety, Ricci promises Bruno to have a feast and go home afterward, forgetting about the search for a moment. When Ricci and Bruno walk into a restaurant, they order mozzarellas and wine as if it is a celebration. It seems like Ricci decides to move on and the story again is heading toward a positive direction. However, Ricci and Bruno are accidentally assigned to a table right next to an opulent family who is having a feast. The multiple back-and-forth cuts of the family’s gluttony as oppose to their simple courses set as a constant remainder to Ricci the indispensable role that money plays in reality. Being pulled back from the fantasy, Ricci realized that the bicycle is the last and only resort to make his family eat again, and he is going to take any means necessary to retrieve it.</p> <h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3> <p>When an American producer told Zavattini that “Hollywood film would show a plane passing overhead, then machine-gun fire, then the plane falling out of the sky but that a Neorealist film would show the plane passing once, then again, then again,” Zavattini replied “It is not enough to have the plane pass by three times; it must pass by twenty times” (T&amp;B, 325). Unlike <em>Bicycle Thieves</em>’s heavy emphasis on the episodic and accidental narrative structure, classical Hollywood productions, like <em>Casablanca</em> (Michael Curtiz, 1942), relied on frequent cuttings and editing to downplay the episodic elements. In doing so, the film can put the focus on the main cause of the story, avoiding any possible distractions and impediments and ultimately offering audiences the perceived perfect ending.</p> <p>“The (search) events are not necessarily signs of something, of a truth of which we are to be convinced, they all carry their own weight, their complete uniqueness, that ambiguity that characterizes any fact”(Bazin, 52). Just as Bazin suggested, by cleverly adding independent accidents along the narrative, it is ambiguous in terms of what exact message <em>Bicycle Thieves</em> wants to send to the audiences. Some audiences might be drawn into the film’s indictment for inequality which permeates the post-WW2 Italian society, while others are affected by the in-depth portrait of father-son power dynamics or the trenchant depiction of religion’s sanctimoniousness. <strong>But does it matter? At the end, when Ricci and Bruno disappear into the masses, their story has become part of our story. And what we might see as something personal has become universal.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="film"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A short analysis on the episodic narrative structure of the classic Italian Neorealists film - Bicycle Thieves]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Thoughts on &quot;Cinemas of Attraction&quot;</title><link href="https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/cinema-of-attraction/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Thoughts on &quot;Cinemas of Attraction&quot;"/><published>2020-11-16T22:56:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-16T22:56:00+00:00</updated><id>https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/cinema-of-attraction</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/cinema-of-attraction/"><![CDATA[<p>In the essay “The Cinema of Attraction,” Gunning made a clear distinction between early theatrical cinema and early narrative films using 1906 as the defining year. He argued that instead of focusing on cinema as a medium that conveyed a sense of logical narratives, early films (prior to 1906) were simply created as a tool for amusements and novelties, which he later defined as “the cinema of attractions.”</p> <p>Inspired by Eisenstein’s “Montage of Attractions” essay, Gunning believed that attractions provoked spectators’ sensual and psychological reactions. The prime goal of early cinema is to proffer such magical illusions to the broad audiences, and all the cinematography and editing techniques utilized (tricks) are for the sole intention to solicit such attention out of them.</p> <p>Gunning credited two significant utilization of attractions in the early cinema. He pointed out that a sense of “actuality” played a crucial role in films before 1906 and is preponderance over narrative films in terms of production. The Lumière Brother, who according to Gunning created films that engage in “placing the world within one’s reach,” were dedicated to provide the most realistic visual sensations to the spectators. Both <em>Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat</em> (1895) and <em>The Sprinkler Sprinkled</em> (1895) simply filmed as a documentary of everyday scenes, however, audiences were still amazed not virtually because of the narration or the theatrical elements but films’ visibility and the exhibited nature.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/coa_1.jpeg" data-lightbox="cinema-origins" data-title="Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/coa_1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> <i>Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat</i> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/coa_2.jpeg" data-lightbox="cinema-origins" data-title="The Sprinkler Sprinkled"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/coa_2.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="The Sprinkler Sprinkled"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> <i>The Sprinkler Sprinkled</i> </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>Méliès, born as a magician, had an even deeper uptake of how films could create such illusory moments for occupying spectators’ attention. Méliès never intended to hide his passion for adopting “tricks” in films. His talented editing skills allowed him to add special effects (making heads disappear, a lady suddenly vanish on the stage) freely in the course of production in films like The Four <em>Troublesome Heads</em> (1898) and The Man with <em>The Rubber Head</em> (1901). Along with his clownish performances, Méliès was again able to put on a pompous show to galvanize the crowd’s reaction, but this time in films. In some of his creations, for instance, <em>Voyage to the Moon</em> (1902), he indeed demonstrated traits of plots, adoptions of traditional theatre, and even repeated actions in two successive shots which were thought to be one of the major signs of continuous, logical narration. Gunning, however, was not totally convinced and went ahead argued that the noticeable underlying narrative structures underlay in Méliès’s films were flagged as being of second or third order importance. They served as a framework for Méliès to fully exhibit his magical effects and tricks in front of the crowd, instead of a standalone entity which would possibly alter spectators’ preexisting perception of films. </p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/coa_3.jpeg" data-lightbox="cinema-origins-2" data-title="Voyage to the Moon"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/coa_3.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="Voyage to the Moon"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> <i>Voyage to the Moon</i> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/coa_4.jpeg" data-lightbox="cinema-origins-2" data-title="The Rubber Head"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/coa_4.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" alt="The Rubber Head"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> <i>The Rubber Head</i> </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>Gunning went further and discredited the neglect of the importance of narrative in the early cinemas by accentuated the fact that technology, not film itself was the imposing attraction. With the existence of the kinetograph, and the nascence of more advanced filming technologies, film creators virtually had neither intentions nor motivations to rigorously work on a self-sufficient plot but often left the film projector itself to do all the talking. Gunning likened going to a traditional film theatre in the past to visit a fairground, which people were enthralled by the latest technological marvel and films were just happened to be the medium of display. Exhibitors would even re-edit the originals by adding sound effects, commentaries to maximize spectators’ corporeal pleasures while soliciting the attention of them.</p> <p>Despite impugning early cinema as merely an implement of courting attention from the mass, Cunning did credit the film creators’ endeavor to maintain a holistic narrative structure. Cunning described these efforts as “ambiguous,” and mentioned Porter’s <em>The Great Train Robbery</em> (1903) as an example. While the robbery story accompanied copious violent actions in the film along with the infamous final close up shot of an outlaw firing further reinforced the point on captivating attention of spectators, Gunning acknowledged Porter’s industry for retaining consistency on continuity. In alignment with Cunning, in the book ”Film History, An Introduction”, Thompson and Bordwell also highlighted Porter as one of the forerunners in creating plot-driven and continuous films. Whether was the employments of repeated actions in <em>Life of an American Fireman</em> (1903) adopted from Méliès or the utilizations of crossing cutting he invented in <em>The Great Train Robbery</em>, Porter’s contribution toward the emergence of continuity editing was undeniable. </p> <p>Finally, Gunning gave out his thoughts on the development of cinema by writing down an incisive claim when approaching to the end of the essay — “Every change in film history implies a change in its address to the spectator, and each period constructs its spectator in a new way.”(8)<d-footnote>The Cinema of Attraction: Early Film, Its Spectator and the Avant-Garde by Tom Gunning</d-footnote> Prior to 1906, the film was considered as a tool for wooing attention from the mass not entirely because of its exhibited nature, but also related to the unconsciousness in which people perceived film, as a medium, could achieve. Close-ups, camera movements, and continuity editing, which are ubiquitous in today’s cinema, were seen as avant-garde. As linearity narrative soon became a norm when constructing a standard film, and spectators gradually accustomed to these drastic changes, however, we will see directors like Jean Renoir and Orson Welles, again, pushing the boundary of production and definition of the cinema.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="film"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An excerpt and a reflection about &quot;Cinemas of Attraction&quot; by Tom Gunning]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I was Born, But…</title><link href="https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/I-was-Born-But/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I was Born, But…"/><published>2020-11-15T00:02:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-15T00:02:00+00:00</updated><id>https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/I-was-Born-But</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/I-was-Born-But/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/assets/img/img4film/i-was-born-but-poster.jpg" data-lightbox="poster"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/i-was-born-but-poster.jpg" alt="PIB Title" width="500"/> </a></p> <p>Although <em>I Was Born, But…</em> (Yasujiro Ozu, 1932) was one of the early works by Ozu, he demonstrates an exceptional aptitude on embodying the callous power dynamics within Japanese working-class structure through the lens of two kids’ growing dismay and perplexity. The film, through a parallel narrative of the father Yoshii (Tatsuo Saito) in work and his children Ryoichi (Hideo Sugawara) and Keiji (Tomio Aoki) in school, presents a keen comparison of the power dynamics of these characters when dealing with convoluted interpersonal relationships. </p> <h3 id="narrative">Narrative</h3> <p><em>I Was Born, But…</em> revolves around the notion of <strong>power</strong>. For salarymen like Yoshii, all the powers concentrate on the hands of the Iwasaki (Takeshi Sakamoto), the big executive in charge of the firm. In order to receive a good salary, and afford a better life for the family, Yoshii racks his mind to hobnob with his boss. Regardless of the physical locations, he would approach Iwasaki in an adulatory manner whenever he has a chance, to not only physically, but mentally live near the boss. Knowing Iwasaki’s passion for film, Yoshii even participates in Iwasaki’s filming of daily vignettes to cater for his interest, which will later trigger a galling incidence, provoking a series of family dramas. While Ozu revealed a bleak image of underlying hierarchies in the adult world and the hypocritical social fabric embedded in the system, he presented a rather humorous and frisky plot via the scope of the neighborhood children, paralleling with the salaryman script.</p> <p>Unlike the adult world brimming with intrigues and office politics, for children, the advent of power lies in <strong>physical strength</strong>. New to the neighborhood, Ryoichi and Keiji struggle to blend in the new environment, especially when they are intimidated by school bullies, led by a bigger kid (Zentaro Iijima). Luckily, they are wise enough to exploit the physical power of the older delivery boy (Shoichi Kofujita), and eventually to supersede the bigger kid as the most dominant figures in the neighborhood. Even Taro (Katô), Iwasaki’s son, has to pay deference to the boys’ incantation. (a game often played among the children)</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_6.jpeg" data-lightbox="cinema-origins"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_6.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> <i>Yoshii participates in the short film produced by his boss</i> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_6.jpeg" data-lightbox="cinema-origins"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_7.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> <i>Ryoichi &amp; Keiji</i> </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>In the sequence in which the kids witness Yoshii accompanying Iwasaki back home, we finally see these two storylines interweave. Ashamed of the fact that Taro’s father is their father’s boss, Ryoichi and Keiji once again cast the incantation on Toro, hoping to regain at least part of their supremacy. However, Yoshii intervenes and halts the game forthwith, helping Taro gets up from the ground as if he is treating his boss at work at the same time reproaching his sons’ impropriety. Of course, the twins would not understand why their father, an undisputed hero figure in their opinion, would treat Taro in such an obsequious manner. Nevertheless, Father’s reprimand is a blow to the brothers’ imaginary fantasy, offering them a snippet of the how things should work in the reality. The scene puts the two independent worlds under the same frame, revealing adult society’s boot-licking conducts as oppose to children’s ingenuous power ideology and imparting them an imperative lesson about the rigid stratification of the society for the first time. </p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_1.png" data-lightbox="cat_2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> <figcaption class="caption"> <i>The encounter between the father and the son</i> </figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <h3 id="camera-movement">Camera Movement</h3> <p>Ozu’s deft camera movements usage are inalienable from narrative functions achieved in <em>I Was Born, But…</em> Nonetheless, the most salient visual style ought to be his utilization of camera movements as a medium to navigate between the two major storylines. Reminiscent of Fritz Lang’s employment of sound as a cue to cut between different spaces in M, (Fritz Lang, 1931), Ozu harnessed the tracking of the camera to establish a relationship between two shots regardless of the discontinuous spaces.</p> <p>In the playground/office scene, a sequence of students marching down the playground is cut to the father’s office smoothly as the camera tracks from left to right. The playful camera movement proffers a sense of verisimilitude as audiences mentally follow the camera motion, navigating between the two settings despite the lack of temporal unity. The juxtaposition of irrelevant sequences also puts two drastically different worlds (children and adults) in compare and contrast with each other, soliciting viewers’ examination of the ulterior motifs behind the image. On the playground, the bigger kid got excoriated by the teacher for not following instructions like other students do. In a cut to the next sequence, the camera, however, now tracking from left to right, capturing an associate who meant to concentrate on work, and shifts right forthwith as he could not resist the soporific working environment and began to yawn like anyone else. These nuances in each character’s synchronous motions allude to the social conformity which everyone ought to obey, epitomizing the foreboding transition from carefree children to institutionalized worker for each person living in the society surrounded by sheer competition.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_2.png" data-lightbox="cat_3"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_3.png" data-lightbox="cat_3"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col text-center"> <figcaption class="caption"> <i>The transition from the playground to the office</i> </figcaption> </div> </div> </div> <h3 id="the-360-degree-system">The 360 Degree System</h3> <p>Although taking immense amounts of inspiration from classical Hollywood comedy, Ozu repeatedly violated the Hollywood continuity editing principle. Instead filming the dialogue scene in the traditional over-the-shoulder method, Ozu framed his dialogue scene more often in a 360-degree style, constantly switching camera positions, proffering a discordant but holistic scene.</p> <p>In the film’s final scene, after understanding the father’s identity and accepting the reality of the life, the two brothers admitted Taro’s father is indeed better. After reconciliation, a straight-on medium long shot shows that the brothers again casting incantation on Taro. In the next shot, however, the camera has already moved behind Ryoichi’s feet, as we observe Taro’s “death” on the ground. At the moment that Ryoichi and Keiji cast the second “revival” incantation in the subsequent shot, the camera has completely switched to the opposite point of view that the initial shot is at, revealing not only the twin brothers but also the train rail barrier. </p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_4.png" data-lightbox="cat_4"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_5.png" data-lightbox="cat_4"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/iwbb_5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col text-center"> <figcaption class="caption"> <i>The use of The 360 Degree camera position</i> </figcaption> </div> </div> </div> <p>People would often associate discontinuity film production such as 360-degree system, uncanny camera positions, and playful editing with a sense of distance and detachment because of the diminishing effect on the temporal unity across the narrative. But for Ozu, the combination of these techniques results the opposite, presenting a self-aware and emotionally-intense everyday scenario which builds upon a direct conversation with the audience. The usage of these cinematic techniques continues to be an inextricable part of Ozu’s cinematic language through his entire film career, embodying his philosophy of straddling the realm of subjectivity and objectivity, and offering contemplative cinemas to viewers not only to realize the sadness and melancholy about the reality of life but to retrospect their own experiences.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="film"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A commentary about Yasujiro Ozu's aptitude in parallel narrative structure, cinematography & 360 degree system in the film I was Born, But...]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Paris Is Burning</title><link href="https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/Paris-Is-Burning/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Paris Is Burning"/><published>2020-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/Paris-Is-Burning</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://zejiac99.github.io/blog/2020/Paris-Is-Burning/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/assets/img/img4film/pib_title.jpeg" data-lightbox="my-image"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/pib_title.jpeg" alt="PIB Title" width="500"/> </a></p> <p>In just little bit over 1 hour, <i>Paris Is Burning</i> (Jennie Livingston, 1990), a seminal and eye-opening documentary, invites us back to the 1980s to survey Harlem’s drag ball subculture, and by extension, queer existence, proffering a snapshot of the late 1980s via the eyes of New York City’s African American LGBTQ community. Interviewing prominent figures of the voguers, both legendary “mothers” of different “houses,” and their “children,” the film introduces us to the underground drag-ball scene as a place for the LGBTQ community to fully realize themselves and escape from this unwelcoming world. </p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/pib_1.jpeg" data-lightbox="cinema-origins"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/pib_1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/pib_2.jpeg" data-lightbox="cinema-origins"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/pib_2.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>“You have three strikes against you in this world, every black man has two - that they are just black and they are male - but you are black and you are male and you are gay.” As one of the voguers suggests at the very beginning, the film reveals the anguish and hardship for black queers to sustain themselves in a world filled with homophobia, transphobia, racism, and poverty. If football and basketball are competitions that make straight people crazy, then the ball is African American queers’ Carnival. It constitutes the narrative of the documentary, and epitomizes the New York City’s queer community’s way of living.</p> <p>The ball refers to a sumptuous but competitive celebration of identity and spirit in the 1980s. The competition is divided into several categories, including mimics of fashion house walk shows, vogue (a style of dancing) competitions, and role playing. People from every corner of the city gather in the ballroom in the most splendid manner to compete, aspiring to bring the “house” down. Every ball is about being real to each other’s identity and at the same time achieve fantasies that would not ever come true in real life. People who are never going to get a job as a corporate executive are wearing formal suits, with cigars in their mouths, walking across the room like they are hurrying to work in Wall Street. Girls who work in the corner stores in your neighborhood can appear fabulously, walking down the ballroom like they are on the runway of the Paris fashion house. Although ephemeral, these vivid performances actualize the fantasy that voguers have been longed for.</p> <p>In the ball, candor and genuineness are two things that matter the most. People can express emotions and desires without withholding their true identities. While the ball emphasizes individualism, “house” begins to emerge as the ball and the vogue evolve into a prevalent subculture in the city. Founded by some of the drag-ball veterans, the “house” signifies family and as a shelter, offering sustenance for “children” who share close aesthetic tastes and deep emotional connections, regardless of their races, identities, or social standing. “LaBeija,” “Ninja,” “Xtravaganza,” kids are willing to forfeit their original family name, and join the “house” as one part of the family. Rivals battle against each other not only for the final grand prize, but the glory of the “house” they represent.</p> <p>Just like the flip side of a coin, behind the intimate and splendor drag-ball scene, however, underlies the anguish and struggles of the queer community, suffering from social prejudice and discrimination from the society. Behind the growth of each “house” is the rising number of children ousted and abandoned by their original families. Displaced kids would come to the ball starving with nothing in their pockets, searching for pleasure, excitement, and most importantly escape from the reality filled with hatred. Kids would steal things to get them to dress up, and come to a ball and live their fantasies for one night. “Girls” are willing to prostitute themselves to fund their transgender surgeries in order to become the most salient star in the ball and make their “family” proud. For many of the participants, the ball is no longer a dreamland, passing over love and positive energy, but highly addictive. It creates a vicious circle in which participants would virtually do anything just for a transient moment of indulgence.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/pib_3.jpeg" data-lightbox="cat_2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/pib_3.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/pib_4.jpeg" data-lightbox="cat_2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/pib_4.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <a href="/assets/img/img4film/pib_5.jpeg" data-lightbox="cat_2"> <img src="/assets/img/img4film/pib_5.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"/> </a> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>Venus Xtravaganza, one of the most tragic figures in the film, is a transgender who aspires to become a star/model, and pines for the social approval of the mass. Like typical teenage girls, she envies spoiled, rich, white girls living lavish lives without worrying to sustain themselves. She dreams to be loved by someone, and lives somewhere far away, where no one can identify her. However, as Venus about to work herself out of the mud, her dream shattered just two years before the premiere of <em>Paris Is Burning</em> as her body was uncovered under a bed in a sleazy hotel four days after being brutally strangled. </p> <p>Venus’s death is just a snippet of the predicament that the African American queer community encountered. <em>Paris Is Burning</em> did a great job in portraying the positive and idealistic side of the drag-ball, but still cannot cover up the cruelty and the indifference that the queer community faced in the reality. At the end of the documentary, voguers finally have an opportunity to display their performances on televisions, music videos, and even fly to Paris to walk on the fashion runway. However, the crowds surrounded them are no longer the congenial “family member” like it used to be, but groups of secular spectators searching for entertainment and senses of novelty. Vogue dance, together with underground drag culture, has been cited as the epitome of the decadent and depressing youth culture in the 80s, and those aspiring youths who dedicate themselves to participating in this spectacle have become just another appealing conversation over the dinner table.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="film"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A commentary about Paris Is Burning, a documentary about NY's queer community in the 90s]]></summary></entry></feed>
